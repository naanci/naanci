## Hi! I'm Nancy 👋
Welcome to my Github! I'm an Information Systems and Applied Mathematics & Statistics major with a strong interest in both the technical and creative side of computing.

## 📌 Skills
Programming Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript

## 👩🏻‍💻 Projects I've Worked On
📂 [Handwriting Computer Recognition](https://github.com/naanci/Computer-Vision-CNN): This project implements convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras to classify handwritten numerical digits using the classic MNIST dataset. Following the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for image classification.

📂 [Airbnb Logistic Regression](https://github.com/naanci/Airbnb-Logistic-Regression-Model): Developed a logistic regresion model to analyze the Airbnb NYC dataset, predicting property success using features such as location, pricing, and availability. This project strengthened my understadning of gradient descent, model implementation, and performance benchmarking against scikit-learn's logistic regression.

📂 [Happiness Level Report](https://github.com/naanci/Happiness-Level-Report) : Built a supervised regression model using the World Happiness Repost dataset to predict the happiness score of countries based on social, economic, and political features. Compared the linear regression model with random forest model that archieved the better performance, highlighting key drivers of happiness are GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, and stablity of happiness scores over time. This project strengthened my skills in feature selection and model evaluation.
